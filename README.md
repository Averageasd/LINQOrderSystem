# Linq demonstration project

## About
An toy project that simulates an order system where users' info along with
their orders and the details of their orders are persisted. In this project,
different features of Linq such as OrderBy, GroupBy, Take, First and Join were
used to connect different entities and extract useful information from these entities.
